# Link-list
Write a program in C/C++ that allows you to store details of items in a grocery – such as,
id, name, category, price, and expiry date – as a list. The program should allow the user to
perform the following operations: insert(x, p, L), delete(x, p, L), search(x, L), print(L),
retrieve(p, L), isEmpty(L), and makeNull(L).
